"I'm barely computer literate. Your website is the easiest I've found to use! THANKS"
"Just a quick email to congratulate you on excellent Customer Service.

"May I thank you most sincerely for the efficient way my order for a Neg.Scanner was handled. It was ordered on Friday Morning (4th Dec) to be delivered by Standard Mail. I then received an e mail informing me that my order was being processed and later that day another e mail to inform me that the item had been dispatched but allow up to 5 days as it was near Christmas. Twenty four hours after placing the order the Scanner was duly delivered ! Grateful thanks "
"Everything. Brilliant website, well laid out. Fantastic delivery, always been very quick, never had any problems at all. Dad always appreciates the sweets in the delivery! Fantastic items, make brilliant presents. I must've spent a fortune on this website! There's something for everyone. Love it. Well done. "

"Good morning. On Saturday afternoon I placed an order with you. It was delivered to my door at 8.30 this morning. Thank you for such prompt and efficient sevice. "

"I would just like to say a huge THANKS for my order which arrived today. Not only was the delivery supersonic, you even enclosed some small gifts which made me smile all day! Many thanks!!! Have a great Christmas! "
"I don't usually fill these things in but I just wanted to say that you have THE BEST gift searcher I've ever come across. I've trawled through so many websites over the last few days while Christmas shopping and none have been as descriptive and easy to use as yours!"
"This email is just for me to express my thanks for the friendliness and helpfulness of your staff, especially 'Bex' (I apologise if this isn't her name). The swift and thorough responses I received were excellent and at no time did I feel I was being brushed aside. When the need arises, I will definitely be using your website again as the customer service is the best I have received from any company in a long, long while. Although the missing item was not Firebox's fault, the urgency and apologetic nature of your staff was refreshing. Thanks again for having some brilliantly trained staff that makes the customer experience much better than many, if not all, your peers. I do believe Bex is new to your company and she is an asset. Regards Ian Moore "
"I just wanted to reply to say thank you very much for your excellent customer service regarding the replacement helicopter and ultra fast service - it is fantastic to find a company that still takes this seriously. My husband also commented on the small (but makes all the difference) things included in the package - the sweets and card. We will definitely be using you again and telling all our friends. Happy Christmas to you all. Regards Michelle Djemil "
"YOU ARE AMAZING!!! Thank you for such fantastic Customer Service. I never dreamt that I would receive this type of response to my comments, you certainly go the extra mile :-). I'm hoping to get to the Post Office at the weekend to return the T-Equaliser and hope that this is acceptable. I will certainly recommend your company to everybody, keep up the good work - it's refreshing to find a company like yours. Julie Stevenson "
"Dear Sharlayne Flanders, Thank you for your swift reply and action. Much appreciated.Your company obviously deserves all of those awards. Cheers Jeanette Lange"

"Hi to all at Firebox, I am emailing to say how pleased I am with the service I received from yourselves recently. I was taking the lazy way out of Christmas shopping and doing it all on-line this year. I placed an order on Tuesday night with Firebox and it was at my door by Thursday- fantastic. The package was well wrapped and protected but to make things even better you supplied me with a small treat.... sweets!!!! This was top class service and I would certainly use Firebox again. Thanks Alana McGrillen Northern Ireland"
"Delivered in good time, safe and sound. Many Thanks for a good service. Regards, John Stewart."
"Love the fact that you can see if an item is in stock - don't have to go to a different screen or wait until you go to checkout. Like the lay out of the website and that you show negative as well as positive comments - would have ordered the periodic table mug and been very disappointed otherwise! Black Ice bat is FAB - brilliant present for "hard to buy for" teenagers! Delivery is brilliant - very quick and easy to track. The courier website is great - my son had gone back home for something and was able to sign for the parcel. Realised this by checking website and seeing goods had been delivered, but as no card left (and parcel not obvious!) I was able to see who had signed for it. "
"YOU ARE AMAZING!!! Thank you for such fantastic Customer Service. I never dreamed that I would receive this type of response to my comments, you certainly go the extra mile :-). I will certainly recommend your company to everybody, keep up the good work - it's refreshing to find a company like yours."
"I ordered from Firebox this year as I did last year, all on-line, and found is so easy(to spend all my hard earned cash as well as the order itself!) I ordered it at 4pm on Tuesday and received it at 8.40am on Thursday which is excellent service! I could track my order which helps as well!! Well done firebox, shall be using you again next Xmas but for Birthday presents as well!!"
"With reference to the above order I write to say 'thank you' for your prompt attention and for the quick delivery. I received the V-beat drumsticks on the 25 November, but as they are for a Christmas present you will understand I have not opened the box. I'm hoping it will be a success! L. Tyre "
"Hi Emma, Well I'm impressed with the level of service and quick response which has left me in an unusually good mood (I've witnessed some shocking customer service before) so for the sake of having to arrange for the item to be returned and taking time out of my day to find a letter box, I really can't be bothered. But I will be ordering form you again if purely on the basis that the customer service was excellent and I need to buy one of those flying screaming monkey's for a secret Santa present. Any chance of some discount? Many thanks for the quick response. Luke Keelan Nice one Emma! "
"Dear sirs, I am writing to express my appreciation for the help given by one of your team recently. I recently purchased an Ecco personal gps locator but mislaid the charger. I contacted you by phone a couple of weeks ago in the vain hope that you may have a replacement charger available to buy. The person who dealt with my query immediately established that you had one, and said she would send it to me. I was amazed when, the next day a parcel arrived with the charger. This was free of charge and carriage. I own a retail business and understand the importance of customer service, and although it is often sadly missing nowadays, your company has restored my faith. Thanks again, Mr D. lill "
" Thank you so much! What wonderful aftercare service you and the team provide, I am sure that your company are pleased to have staff like you and and what a great reputation it will build. I really didn't expect to be able get a replacement of any kind and feared that I may have to buy a whole new unit, so I am so pleased that you have been able to help and I thank you so much. We will certainly look at your site first when we go to buy things again and will recommend you as well. Early I know, but a very Happy Christmas to you and everyone there and all the best for 2010. Kindest regards Alma x"

"I placed an order with you on the 23/11/09. You sent me an email to keep me up to date with its movements via City Link. It turned up at 9am on the 25/11/09. It was in fantastic condition and complete. Rarely do customers such as myself get such service and satisfaction from many internet orders/companies. You are amazing people with fantastic customer service and I feel people are more than happy to complain if goods are not a good standard or are given a bad service so its only right that I feel I Must let you know how very pleased I am with your exceptional service, quality and customer care. Thank you kindly. I Will be placing another order today with you."
"Hi Everyone at Firebox. I Received my order today, Thank you very much. I just want to say what a fantastic team you must have there.

I will recommend you to all my family and friends. I wish you all A Very Happy Christmas and Every Success for the New Year. Best Wishes. "
"It was a pleasure ordering from you. The customer service officer who took my order was fun, charming and efficient and made ordering a total pleasure! Your team are very efficient (I've placed a couple of orders) and polite. I have ordered from other mags for this Christmas and I must say that you were one of the best because you made ordering fun, with a light hearted person on the other end of the phone, instead of someone who is too busy rushing you through the order and obviously not enjoying their job! Hope this helps! "
"Firebox rocks! I got an email from you yesterday to say my order had been shipped and I had my order by 8.40am this morning! Thank you!"
"Great service. Thanks for being so quick."
"I ordered gifts for everyone. I have managed to buy my wife, my children aged 8 and 6 and myself presents for Christmas. Basically my Christmas got wrapped up with 2 visits to your website."
"I just wanted to say a massive thank you for my 'Superhero in a box' that arrived this morning - it is fantastic! My little 'SuperBoy' is going to love it when he gets it on Xmas morning! Brilliant service too - I only ordered it yesterday lunchtime. Thanks again, Firebox - A VERY satisfied customer!"
"Firebox thanks for your speedy reply. I did receive the product and only the day after I placed the order - exceptional service! "
"It's wacky, yet efficient. Love the creativity that's gone into the product descriptions. More items at lower prices would be great. Well, I would say that, wouldn't I? One of the best on-line retailers I've dealt with. "
"I just wanted to let you know that firebox.com is brilliant! I do all my shopping over the internet, and they are the best by far. Everything always comes as described, usually the next day. (Which is quite a feat as I live in the middle of nowhere!)."
"Excellent fast service, ordered one afternoon, delivered the next morning, smashing!"
"Bless you for this wonderful event. Emails from you are like a bright summers day. They bring joy and warmth to my heart. When I read them I dance like a pixie and run barefoot on the lawn laughing and skipping uncontrollably! Thank you for spending your valuable time to even think of me. Thank you for taking the time to contact me. Thank you Thank you! Every syllable I cherish, every vowel warms me, your consonants bring me happiness. I wish you peace and tranquillity for all time."
"Unbelievable speed of delivery. The standard post took less than 24 hours, quite simply amazing. Well done Royal mail as well. I will recommend to everyone I know due to the products and speed of delivery 10/10."
"I ordered 2 x 'Rainbow in my room' as presents on Sunday evening, The products arrived today (Wednesday) so very fast delivery to Ireland. One order came in Christmas paper and the other was using Crap wrap. Just fab! Made me smile! BEAUTIFUL gift, I can't wait for Christmas now! Also, thanks for the sweets, my daughter loved them. Would recommend you to all my friends! Thanks again!"
"I received my order yesterday and I was really impressed with speed of delivery and the great packaging (plus surprise sweeties!) The product looks great and is a perfect gift for my 'difficult to buy for' relative. It is always a worry buying on-line around Christmas and I have had problems with others in the past. This was my first experience of your site and I will definitely be coming back. "
"I have received the item today and am very very happy with both the item and your fantastic service. Please forward this to the relevant people. Regards, A very very happy customer"
"Dear Firebox, I recently bought a present from your website for my friends 21st which (down to by friend) did not get delivered successfully. This happened numerous times and a normal online retailer would have dealt with this situation very differently (by that I mean poorly), but I must say the customer service I received from one of your employees (Kylie) was outstanding. I will definitely recommend you to my friends."
"I just wanted to say a great big thank you for such a fantastic product range and service you supply. I was thrilled with my packages received, not only was it packed to perfection, but there was not a single mark on any of the inner boxes! A big up to the warehouse team! I was so impressed that I've been banging on about you guys since! Most certainly a company I will return too! My list is already building ready for next pay day! Thank you again, "
"What a fantastic website with fantastic gift ideas! We recently received the Wattson from Firebox as it was part of a prize from a competition, not only is it an awesome energy monitoring gadget, but it introduced us to Firebox, Bonus!!!"
" Can I just say a massive THANK YOU to you for your outstanding customer service in this matter. Not only did you deal with my enquiry quickly, but you found me as a customer in your records, sent me the product gratis and it was here even before I had read the email telling me it was on its way!! In a country where customer service seems to be slowly dying out, you have acted with supreme efficiency and excellence and I am quite simply blown away. Many thanks again for all you have done. My wife and I had been busy reading the catalogue for Xmas present ideas and look forward to being able to return your favours by continuing to shop with you. "
"Hello Firebox People ! Just wanted to say a big 'thank you 'for the excellent service provided on my order. I put this order through on the Internet yesterday lunchtime and the parcel has just been delivered by the Royal Mail, so that's all done in actually less than 24 hours. That's pretty impressive stuff guys ! Thank you..... Hope you all have a good weekend, Cheers,"
"Just felt compelled to write and say what a great job you did with my recent order and thankyou. I saw an item you mentioned in the Sunday Times....a USB Snake Camera. You guys sell it cheaper than anyone else (by a good margin). I'm in the construction business and I know the product will come in handy. What really impressed me was the communication and the speed in which you delivered the item. Plus it was really well packaged and came with a free bag of sweets! I ordered on Sunday night, around 11pm. I didn't upgrade to the special post as I was in no great rush. The item was on my doorstep early Tuesday morning. Impressive. I was emailed to know the order had been made and then again when it was despatched. I would never normally be sad enough to write in congratulations like this, but just felt I should as I have had so many bad/mediocre experiences with ordering online that it was a refreshing change dealing with Firebox. I'll be buying some Christmas pressies for people soon."
"Thank you for your great customer service! I will definately be shopping with you again."
"Easy to use site, great communication and super fast delivery. A pleasure to shop online with Firebox, I will continue to use as it's a pleasure to shop here."
"Firebox are the gem of the Internet. I can think of no other company that, in my experience, gets it right every time. Well done Firebox. "
" What great service! I placed an order yesterday & it was delivered this morning!!!! - and with a cheery smile from the Courier too!!!! Thanks all round to all concerned."
"Order arrived as fast as ever, and everything in it is brilliant. You are by far & away the best internet company and your website is excellent too. Thank you so much. "
"I love everything about this site - you guys could make second hand dog poo sound cool and sell it! It's great - I love all the little gadgets and pointless stuff which I still just really want to buy! I also love how you obviously read peoples reviews and respond on the webpage to those necessary."
"I have recieved the item today and am very very happy with both the item and your fantastic service. Please forward this to the relevant people. regards a very very happy customer"
"Please will you send a catalogue to my home address as the one I have received at work has gone round the office and I have not got it back !!!"
"Thanx once again for a perfect & super-fast order. It's rare these days to actually compliment someone on a job well done but you guys are the business. . I always check your website for the latest in play things & I've never been disappointed with my orders. Thanx once again for bringing us toys for big people. Love the cuter elements for us girl fans too, keep it up ;) "
"Excellent service, despite the postal strike, my order arrived today. Thank you very much"
" Thanks, it came this morning - I was impressed! It's like those films where someone orders something and they are at the door before they put down the phone."
"An absolutely amazing company - I ordered my items on-line around 5pm and the next morning they were delivered! Outstanding! The variety of products and easy lay out of the site makes searching for presents stress free and worthy of a lunchtime spent looking. "
"I love firebox! You have such a great range of products. Since I found out about you guys I havent stopped using you."
"Thank you very much for the fast delivery of my order. I only ordered the recording kit at 5pm on Monday and it arrived at 5 past 9 this morning (Tuesday). Great service, thank you "
"I'd just like to say what a quality service you provided with a recent purchase. Ordered pm on the 6th October and my item turned up the following morning. Faultless service. Not only that but there were some sweets in with the order (that my 2 little boys nabbed) plus a code for free delivery on my next order. Brilliant. I work in dispatch myself so appreciate the speed of delivery and the confirmation emails. Cracking service. "
"Excellent service on purchases. Good follow up and after sales communication. Lots of wierd and wonderful products. Great and funny blurbs..."
"I love everything about this site - you guys could make second hand dog poo sound cool and sell it! It's great - I love all the little gadgets and pointless stuff which I still just really want to buy! I also love how you obviously read peoples reviews and respond on the webpage to those necessary. "
"Thank you for the great service. I will have no doubt whatsoever in recommending you to friends and will definitely continue to shop with you again. As a public sector worker it's easy to complain but very little effort is placed on taking the time to pass on gratitude for a good job..."
"I just had to email you to express my total admiration for your Customer Service, it is without doubt the best I have ever come across. Trust me I know what I am talking about, I worked for a very large well known company in the Customer Service field for 25 years, I have to say, you leave them standing. I spoke to a very pleasant and helpful young man yesterday, (I am afraid I made a pigs ear of trying to place an order online) anyway I called the number listed and explained my concerns. Far from making me feel like the idiot I felt I was, your young man put me at ease and very pleasantly talked me through my order. Not only that it was after 3pm when I placed my order and he assured me that if I used next day delivery then I would receive the goods between 8am and 12 noon, to be honest I thought, I doubt it at this late time of ordering. Well I did receive the goods at 10.25am this morning. What a breath of fresh air you and the people working in your organisation are. I havent used the goods yet but I am in absolute no doubt that your Company will follow through with the quality I have so far experienced. Thank you so much, you have renewed my faith in The British Company. I will let you know what I think of the product as soon as I use it. A Very Happy Customer"
"I literally think I just lost half an hour of my day hitting the randomiser button on firebox and pointing out to every1 in the office.. we should get one of those, to pretty much EVERYTHING that came up!! "
"I absolutely love everything about this site! Informative descriptions on everything, easy to browse around and excellent review system. I think I'd like one of everything!"
"You guys are amazing! I've been shopping with you since the year 2001 and never been disappointed. You are my favourite gift bookmark!!! Thanks Firebox"
"Just wanted to pass on some feedback for the service I recently received. I made an order of 5 or 6 items and much to my dissatisfaction, one of the items was missing upon delivery. All it took was a single phone call to report the item missing and another was dispatched with no quibble and no delay. I've heard of friends experiencing similar issues with other companies and having to go through the long-winded processes of filing reports and waiting a period of time whilst investigations happen. I appreciate your commitment to customer satisfaction. Cheers! "
"Absolutely fantastic. Only ordered yesterday afternoon & postman delivered this morning. Brilliant! Will recommend your site to friends. "
"You are fantastic!!! I will certainly make you my first port for Xmas shopping!! "

"Just wanted to drop you a quick "thank you" email for your customer service team. Unfortunately, I've had to send back a flight experience due to the closure of a Manchester site Your team was extremely helpful, they looked at alternative options for me and in the end sorted out the refund quickly! As usual, a pleasure to deal with your company. If you could forward on my thanks, that would be appreciated."
"I'm sending this email just to say thank you for the excellent quality of service and product that you provide. I have been constantly impressed by the supreme quality of everything you do and the extra thoughts you include such as personal messages if I'm buying a present and the complimentary sweets you send out with every order. I hope you continue in thinking of such novel ideas!. "
"I'd like to say a big Thank-You to Firebox for the excellent Customer Service that I have received. The replacement BBQ was delivered in an impressively timely manner. I will be sure to be very complementary when telling all of my friends about your web site. Once again Thank-You."

"Just a quick note to thank you for the prompt replacement of my Senz umbrella, your system for returning items for replacement is second to none. Thanks again."
"I wanted to send an e-mail to congratulate you on the efficiency of Firebox. I run a business myself and it is rare anybody gives you feedback when things are good. I wanted to let you know the service and efficiency of Firebox has been really impressive. From purchase to completion including customer service and delivery has all been excellent."
"I just wanted to say a great big thank you for such a fantastic product range and service you supply. I was thrilled with my packages received, not only was it packed to perfection, but there was not a single mark on any of the inner boxes! A big up to the warehouse team! I was so impressed that I've been banging on about you guys since! Most certainly a company I will return too! My list is already building ready for next pay day! Thank you again, "
"I'd just like to say how impressed I am with the speed of the service and the efficiency in the way that my order has been dealt with. I work in customer service for a very large online clothes retailer (I won't say who!) and you put our service to shame!"
"There's nothing that i can think of to improve about Firebox. I've shopped with yourselves a few times now and have been 100% happy on all occasions. Thank you and keep it up!"
"Hi, I don't often do this but I would like to thank you very much for my Airwave it's brill!! ...And more to the point what a joy it was doing business with your company, like I say I don't often do this but service like yours is a rare thing and I felt I had to thank you for a job well done! Keep up the good work!"
"I felt I had to email you to tell you about my weekend. I was given a twilight umbrella for christmas and I also bought two for christmas presents. Not having used it very much I thought I would take it to Glastonbury Festival.To my amazement I was the only person there with one! I was sure there would be lots of other ones there too. So MANY people stopped to admire it and ask where i got! I told them all i got it from you and most said they were off home to order one!!! I LOVE mine and so do the people i gave them to at christmas. I hope you don't mind the advertising and hope you have some in stock!!!!! From Justine (a very satisfied customer! Just wish I was going to some more festivals over the summer so I could take it too!!!!!!) "

"Hi Dylan, Thanks for your recent email giving details concerning the return of fairy lights. Just to say I have now received the replacement set. I really just wanted to acknowledge your excellent service and clearest instructions regarding return of the faulty set and this was - and is - most appreciated. I particularly enjoyed the Aero bar enclosed with the new set!! Nice touch. Well done; brilliant service. I would also appreciate my email address being registered with Firebox to ensure I'm kept updated concerning special offers, etc. Best wishes. "
"I think I first used your website around 10 years ago when it was 'Hotbox' and thought it was brilliant. I have just gone back online to get some ideas for a friend's 30th birthday and still think you guys are utterly fantastic with an excellent concept. I don't know why I'm emailing you to tell you this but I just felt like it..... Well done Ben "
"Nothing, a great colourful web site with superb products, helpful reviews and the delivery was so quick it must have been sent via Firebox Teleport (TM) Technology! Many thanks, Mark."

"I was at an associate's house in Grassmoor when I mentioned that I had just bought one of your 3.5 inch digital photo frames. He was interested so I opened your web page and he placed an order on the spot. Now here's the clever bit, by the time I left, about 1.5 hours later, there was a message in his Inbox stating that it had been despatched. That is a remarkably quick turn-a-round. Well done. With luck and weather permitting it should have been delivered on Saturday or Monday. I just hope my associate is as pleased with it as I am. I have already bought a second one as a present for a family friend as a thank-you for helping me out last year."
"Received my Voodoo Knife Block this morning, outstanding delivery service and product.....Already looking what else I can buy from you. One happy customer, well done."

"A personal thank you message to the support team. The item has arrived and is now wrapped under the Christmas tree. I am really impressed with the care that you take to keep customers informed at every stage of the transaction.

"I'm just emailing to say how good the 'collect from local post office' delivery service is - efficient and easy - and it will hopefully help towards keeping local post offices in business. It just tops your excellent service - I think you are one of the most efficient web retailers around - if only I could get all my Christmas shopping from you!"

"Hi, I am very impressed that you took the time to write back to me - and a personal e-mail that I can tell you did not just copy and paste! I can't remember the last time I was aware of such good customer service. My parcel did arrive safely - much to my amazement. I have very dodgy neighbours and our mail boxes are all lined up in a row (we live in a block of flats), so there was every chance for someone to spot the firebox logo and get over excited at the opportunity! Luckily, my dad will still get his christmas pressie this year."
"This is, quite frankly, exceptional service. "
"Hi Alexandra Thank you so much. I am very impressed with that response, I was preparing myself to argue the point as we have to more and more these days. But thank you for that, that has made my day. I can go and buy her another toy now! and she can't have it until christmas this time!! :-)"
"Just wanted to say that I received the Freudian slippers in the post yesterday. The delivery was very quick especially considering the time of year. My sister in law who is a psychology teacher will absolutely love this present!! I was quite sceptical about ordering online with a company i had never heard of, but thanks to your quick and efficient service i will definitely spread the word, my two teenagers are already in love with the catologue."
"Just to say... I have just received my order in Budapest via TNT delivery The process from start to finish has been fantastic and to get something to work that efficiently is amazing. I will certainly recommend firebox to other xpats here and put future orders in myself, "

"I just wanted to email you all there at Firebox and say - not only is crap wrap a genius idea but your email marketing and tone of voice is totally brilliant! Firebox emails always cheer me up and crap wrap has put the cherry on top of the years activity (or should that be the fairy on top). "

"I think all companies should aspire to provide this level of service. Mine does and Firebox obviously does too. Without wanting to sound corny, it definitely makes me inclined to buy more and recommend you too, so thank you very much."
"I've never used your site before, but I stumbled across it last week by pure chance, and I'm very glad I did. I'm impressed with the variety of items you stock, which was great when I needed some gift inspiration. I'm also extremely impressed with just how quickly I received them, they were dispatched within 24 hours, and with me the next morning. The packaging was simple but effective, and the addition of a few vouchers and a free pack of sweets? Brilliant. "
"I just wanted to say how impressed I am with your service. I ordered my goods from you at 9.30 yesterday morning on a standard delivery service and received them at 8.30 this morning!

"Good Afternoon I just wanted to say a big thank you.

She is a credit to your company, and because of my good experience I will definitely use firebox.com in the future. Best Wishes, Kevin. "
"Excellent, thank you. You are as good as I thought you were!!!! "
"I have collected my order from my local post office thank you. I am liking this service very much so, and I'm finding it a very speedy service that you provide. I use this service as Im out for a good part of the day and usually items require a signature, so having my local post office signing for them makes life so much easier than having to drive to the local depot to collect parcels, whenI can walk 2 mins to collect them. You are the only company I am aware of that offers this service, which makes me choose Firebox.com everytime. "
"Firebox - you are spectacular!!!! Parcel arrived this morning, thank you so much for your speedy despatch and delivery!"

Thank you for making my summer so much better (: You all deserve a party and a raise. Woopwoop Love, A satisfied customer x"

"I just had to contact you to commend you on a fantastic service. I received my order at 12 o'clock today, after placing the order at ten to five yesterday. I couldn't believe it when I saw the card from Royal Mail telling me that I had a parcel in my post box. Service like this is, unfortunately, very rare nowadays."
"I received my parcel today and wanted to thank you for excellent service ! "

Thanks again - hopefully I will have one very happy birthday boy!! C Wiltshire "
"This is just a quick note of thanks for superb service. I am currently out of the country on business and ordered my boyfriend an anniversary gift yesterday afternoon. With the prompt assistance of Emily Herriott it arrived today on his desk in London (as a gift - since she removed all the other proof purchase doc's) and made me look like an incredibly thoughtful girlfriend! Much appreciated! I wish you all success and will most certainly recommend you to my friends and colleagues. "

I placed an order at the very last minute before Christmas not expecting for one minute that it would arrive in time but to my complete amazement, it arrived within 2 days and made my daughter extremely happy!! I will most definitely use your company again and will recommend them to my family and friends. Thank you Firebox."
"Yesterday, at 2.20pm, I ordered a Stylophone after seeing it in the catalogue - and using the code on the back of it, got free postage too. And here it is sat on my desk this morning, INCLUDING a packet of fizzy cola bottles. Marvellous! I'm really very chuffed. Well done Firebox! "
"I felt I had to write to let you know how pleased I was with the service I got from Firebox.com. I placed an order late on Sunday evening (20/01/08) which was a birthday gift for my grandson. I couldn't believe it when the delivery man pressed my intercom this morning at 10.30am to say he had a package for me, which of course was the gift I ordered from yourselves. I was really amazed at the speed this order was completed in, plus the packaging inside was excellent ensuring that no damage would harm my gift. All in all a wonderful service, and I will certainly be using Firebox.com again in the future as well as telling my friends about it. The tracking service is also an excellent feature, giving you peace of mind, all in all I'm very happy....................... Here's hoping my 9yr old grandson is happy with my choice of present for him.........Hee!"
"Words cannot say how impressed we are with your company. Thank you Firebox - you are the tops!"
"Happy New Year to you all. Just wanted to thank you for your efficient service. I found the ordering process on the web easy to follow and got my order when promised. This is much appreciated especially being so close to Christmas. Thanks Very Much "
"I am really impressed with your service. My son is delighted to have a replacement gun, and this one works fine, much to his sister's disgust.... I have ordered several items from you in the past and I will carry on buying from you with such a good service. Many regards and a happy new year."
"I just wanted to say a big THANKYOU for such brilliantly efficient service! "
"I am just emailing to thank you for such a good service, you provided my products in good time and at a good price. Have a good 2008. "
"I just want to say a really big thank you to all at Firebox, for your amazing efficiency and speed of delivery. I ordered last Friday, and my box of boy's toys came on the Saturday morning. Now I call that superb. Many thanks and Happy New Year to you all."
"Thank you very much for your excellent service; I will certainly use you again in the future."
"Thank-you for this order, it arrived this morning which is less than 24hours after it was placed. Amazing speed compared with our Amazon order this year which took nearly three weeks!!"
"I don't really like giving top marks in any survey - but was unable to fault you even though I tried ! Well done you - keep up the good work. Excellent service, exceptionally quick delivery, and courteous friendly customer relations staff. Problem solved !! Will definitely be back next Christmas if not before! Thanks."
"You have by far the best online customer service team I have ever dealt with. It's a credit to you. Merry Christmas to you."
"I just want to add it was a pleasure dealing with your company and your eagerness to help without any quibble. It is a very refreshing attitude and a joy to do business with you. I will definitely use you again and will highly recommend you Cheers and A very Merry Christmas to all. PPS. The helicopter is brilliant (it may not make it's final destination and remain one of my toys)"
"I felt the need to write to congratulate you and your team on an astonishing customer experience. I order from Firebox from time to time and have done for several years. My Christmas gift list often comes from Firebox?s extensive catalogue. This year, I hadn?t got round to ordering until yesterday so decided to use express delivery to get the goods here during the week. First of all the stocks you hold made my selection easy ? yes there were one or two items which I would have ordered had they been in stock but all are clearly marked. Secondly I was offered a Monday (today) delivery which I thought was a mistake ? hence my query to your team (see attachment). And finally the goods arrived before 9am to give me the rest of the day to do other things. In my view, you have certainly raised the bar ? and now my expectations! Absolutely superb service. Thanks once again, "
"Just like to thank you on such a wonderful service! You always hear about the complaints and never about the good stuff. I ordered a cup on the Thurs 20th December and arrived the next day (you must have Superman working for you). Unfortunately, the cup had a crack in it. I rang customer services and I was told that my item would be replaced and delivered the very next day, and it was. How Fab! Even the guy I spoke to told me he had no hold button and offered to sing instead, I told him I wasn't that cruel. Thank you for such a stress free Christmas, I have and will be recommending you to all my friends and family."
"I ordered a few last minute christmas presents from your website yesterday and I'm just emailing to tell you how impressed I was. I ordered at about 1pm yesterday and they arrived before I was even awake this morning at 8am! The presents look fab and I'll definitely be ordering from you again. The Haribo was a nice touch too, you don't get that with Amazon! Keep up the good work!"
"Just wanted to say you guys are great! My package has made it to Hong Kong already! 2 days, I can't get local post that quick. The girls in the office and I also wanted to thank you for the sweeties - nice afternoon snack. Thanks and I can confirm that you are indeed the best for Christmas and indeed any other time for that matter."
"I just wanted to say how fantastic your service is. The professionally packaged parcels with the personal touch of a note or sweets is really nice. The website is excellent and I have recommended you to numerous friends. My only criticism is that I could have done with more products to choose from! Amazon charge too much postage and have become unreliable and have subbed out to many of their services to unscrupulous traders so I won't use them. I look forward to again doing lots of my Xmas shopping with Firebox next year. Best wishes"
"I just wanted to say thank you for making the whole process of returning my faulty duck & getting a replacement so easy. I am very happy with the service I have received from yourselves and will not hesitate to recommend Firebox to anyone & everyone. Thank you again "
"It's customer service like this (and the great products) that mean I'll continue to shop with you AND recommend you to my friends! Many thanks :-)"
"I am not quite sure how to rate your service online. I placed the order for the Instant Music Ripper on Friday around 4 p.m. and selected the Saturday option, although I admit I was sceptical about such a promise. Imagine my surprise when the delivery arrived at 10.30 a.m. on the Saturday morning. Most other retailers I have used would probably still be hunting through their warehouse and strolling down to dispatch with the items by the time this delivery was made. Thank you for living up to your promises and providing a proper customer service which is so hard to find these days. P.S. Thanks also for the fun gums friendship rings although, unfortunately, my wife was around when I opened the package. Alas, while I was still stunned by the delivery speed the rings were devoured all but one. "
"This is just an email to say thank you for the service. I am so impressed because, frankly, every company under the sun seems like they don't care about me, but in almost exactly 24 hours you manage to get an Order to my door. If every company were as good as the service I received from you, well.... I would be this happy all the time I suppose! Anyway, I hope it's good to get an email thats not a question or moan, thank you again."
"I just wanted to write a note to say thank you very much for the EXCELLENT level of service I have experienced. You have really exceeded my expectations is trying to get my parcel to me. This is a very refreshing experience in comparison to some online sites. Well done!"
"I'd just like to take this opportunity to let you know that I'm very impressed with your service. I've used you several times over the years and the transactions have always gone very smoothly and very very efficiently, and I'm always kept updated. I can't remember a service that I've been so impressed with. In fact I don't think there has been one. So Thank you very much :-) "
"I would just like to take a little time to express my total and utter satisfaction with your service. Having worked in retail myself (although not an internet based company) I'm well aware of a customers willingness to relay dissatisfaction to a company but "blood from a stone" like unwillingness to bestow any kind of gratitude upon a company. I would like to break this (not quite as inevitable as we all thought) cycle. I would be the first to admit that i am without doubt an almost mind bogglingly poor present sender. But my affliction has (in no small way) been aswaged by the good people at Firebox. Not only is the range of products on your website second to none but the level of service you provide "post sale" is also universally excellent. At no point have i been in any way dissatisfied with any part of my buying experience with Firebox. I have, and will continue to, recommend thoroughly and to an almost annoying degree your website to my friends, work colleagues and at times random people on the street! Thanks again."
"Good morning, the postman arrived at 8.00 today together with a delivery of the Candy Grabber for our Grandson (and his father). Thank you for the very excellent service."
"I am more than pleased with the product and the service of Firebox. I usually don't have positive experiences overall but the staff from your company has been helpful, pleasant and very accommodating. I really appreciate it immensely. You definitely have a customer for life."
"My online voucher didn't work when I ordered the product and I sent an email asking about it. I received a reply within 2 minutes to say I would receive a refund to the value of the voucher on my credit card within a few days -fantastic customer service! I was/am really really impressed! "
"Dear Firebox, I am really impressed with your service !! I ordered a gift for my daughter at 3.08pm yesterday (7th June 07) You confirmed receipt at 3.08pm. You detailed packing at 3.13pm. You despatched the order at 5.55pm and gave me full details of courier and a tracking option. The gift arrived this morning in perfect condition at 8.48am ! There was even a card with personalised message and a pack of free sweets in the box ! I am speechless !"
"Just an email to thank you for fantastic service! I've received my order today (which arrived incredibly quickly) and it's 100% spot on! I'm well impressed! Thank you for making Xmas shopping surprisingly painless!"
"I would like to thank you very much for your excellent service. I will definitely use you again."
"Thank you so much for the speedy dispatch of this item - it was delivered on Monday. I am delighted with the product, your website, and, most of all, with your excellent customer service - courtesy and speed - fantastic!!"
"Just to say thanks for some great service. My daughter saw the "voodoo charms"in the catalogue and as her birthday was a few days away I decided to order them as a surprise, not expecting to get them in time for the day itself. Iordered them Thursday morning, they arrived Friday and they were opened by a highly delighted daughter on Saturday morning! Thanks for that."
"I just wished to write to say thank you so much for processing my order so quickly. I only ordered the item yesterday and it has arrived this morning already. The item was well packaged and exactly as described. It is wonderful to be able to order something and have it processed and despatched so quickly. Keep up the excellent work."
"I would just like to say congratulations on running such great customer service for a website of this sort! Ive had a few orders in the last few days and am really impressed with speed and quality it was processed. Also just had a complicated order which was dealt with much faster and easier than i expected! Thanks ! "
"Received within 24 hours of ordering.....thank you so much for your excellent service."
"I just wanted to tell you what a wonderful service Firebox has provided me with. This item (Playdock Z500) is virtually impossible to get in the UK unless you wait 6 to 8 weeks. Firebox (you) responded to my email almost immediately to tell me it was in stock. I ordered it Tuesday and got it at 9.15 am the following morning. Although the box was slightly damaged, the actual packing was fantastic and it works like a charm. The process of buying it itself was a pleasure, with your emails being kind and courteous and very fast. I, like the idiot that I am, had only inputted my work address so you rang me to ask me my home one (again some 30 or so minutes after order was passed). I got email after email telling me exactly what my order was doing and that was absolutely fab. I will also tell my colleagues at work and friends what a superb service you provide and as I am the first one to moan about bad service (plenty to moan about). I have to be the first to point out when a firm is excellent. Yours certainly is."
"I ordered an Evel Knievel toy on Thursday night. It arrived first thing Saturday morning. Not only was I delighted with the superb "King of the Stuntmen", I was extremely impressed with your service. I will not hesitate in using you again or recommending you to my friends. Thank you for your excellent service and for reminding this 36 year old that The Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle was, and still is, the finest toy ever made. Feel free to use my comments anywhere on your site. The more people know of your brilliant products and service, the better. Thanks once again."
"This was the first time I had ordered from Firebox as I was going to order from I Want One Of Those.com but the product was out of stock.. I truly cannot stress how EXTREMELY impressed I was with the entire service. I was literally shocked how quickly my order arrived. I ordered the plane on Wednesday and with the basic standard post option it was delivered to my door mid Thursday. I was just so pleased with the whole process. Very good use of packing a fragile product like my plane with branded air pockets. I have genuinely recommended your site to many friends already and would definitely do business with you in the very near future. It makes a nice change when a company using the internet as a distribution channel can managed to provide a top notch service. Keep up the great work."
"Thanxxxxx to all those involved in processing & dispatching my order of 'Love Tokens'. I've never known such swift service. The quality of merchandise in it's cute red velvet bag is top notch too (well done the buyers)! The Love Tokens will make ideal wedding gifts for my friends 'who have everything"! I look forward to your next original gift idea. Keep up the good work!"
"Excellent, brilliant. amazing truly genuine service. What else can I say? I ordered my PicooZ Helicopter on Friday afternoon and it was delivered at 0830hrs on Saturday. This was brilliant and is the best service I have ever received when ordering goods over the internet. You have definitely been bookmarked and your range of other products looks brilliant "I shall return"."
"Firebox' delivery and service. This time I am actually totally speechless, honestly. I allowed a week for delivery for an item. Therefore I ordered 3 items on Friday afternoon at 3pm (approx). Therefore I was expecting to see it somewhere around Wed/Thurs. I woke up on Saturday morning (yes the day after) to the package on my door - I have used Firebox many times before, this is the reason why i come back. Fantastic products, fantastic service. You guys / girls have done yourself proud!!! "
"You guys are awesome! I received my orders from the UK faster than I receive them from the other side of Houston!!! Thanks for supplying fun tech toys in a timely manner!"
"I would just like to say a big thank you to you all. I was so impressed how quick I received my order and thank you for the little bag of sweets, a nice little gesture. It's very unusual that we get good service these days, and all we normally do is moan about companies, that is why I thought I would like to say THANK YOU once again!"
"I'd just likes to say a big thanx to everybody at Firebox for getting my order to me so quickly, that's half my Xmas shopping done!! Thanx again, oh and thanx for the sweets they were delicious!!"
"I would just like to say thank you for an excellent service. I have, today, received my order after only ordering it Sunday evening. What a shame that a few other companies are not capable of such a professional service."
"Just a quick note to say I'm very pleased with the service. Delivery time was exceptional - particularly at this time of year, and the quality of goods ranged from very good to fantastic. Keep up the good work."
"I just wanted to say that Firebox is by far the best internet shop I have ever used. I received my order today and am very happy. All round great service."
"Many thanks, my order arrived this afternoon. The items are all excellent and I would like to thank all at Firebox for your first rate service and communications."
"I would just like to say a big thank you for your excellent service. The gift I ordered has arrived and I have been informed of its progress since ordering, both by email and phone. I admit to being wary of ordering two weeks before Christmas from a company I hadn't previously heard of, but will have no hesitation telling my friends about you. Many thanks and Happy Christmas to all!"
"You're always fast, but that was really fast! I placed several orders with different companies yesterday, but your lightning-fast delivery beat the lot yet again. Thanks a lot (I liked one thing so much that I'm going to order another) and thanks for the sweets too, which I'm ashamed to say I've eaten already! Keep doing what you're doing because it's superb and have a Merry Christmas! "
"My order has arrived and it's a super quick service, and everyone in the office is laughing at the Duck Fadar! I think I have successfully converted approximately 20 people to the ways of the Firebox!!!! Keep up the supduperstupendous work! "
"I have received my parcel and would like to thank you for your excellent service - can't belive how quickly it has arrived. Very impressed!"
"Many thanks for super fast delivery-less than 24 hrs from order to receipt! Very impressed!"
"I have used your website several times now and I just wanted to drop you a message to say how fantastic I find both your website and service. I have ordered several items in the past, each item is always delivered securely and packaged to the highest standard. The icing on the cake is the speed of delivery... Amazing! So keep up the good work and I will continue to enjoy your service, regards to the rest of the team and although this may be a tad early... Merry Christmas! "
"I would just like to say a very big thank you to everyone at firebox. I placed my first order with you on Tuesday 21st Nov. at 11.30.a.m. and it arrived at my door this morning at 9.00a.m., thats less than 24hrs. now that is what I call service!"
"Hello Firebox! Thanks for your very promt delivery, you have made my grandson's Christmas a very happy one. He will be really chuffed when he opens his present on Christmas Day. Thanks again, I have told all my work mates to use this site!"
"Just to say many thanks for sending out the items so promptly, brilliant service! Thanks."
"Fantastic! I ordered some stocking fillers from your website yesterday morning and they arrived this morning. Great service."
"I cant believe how quick the order came. What a company. Thank you very much, everything was great. I will use you again."
"I ordered some presents for Christmas from your website, the service I received was amazing. The delivery was next day, wonderfully packed. I do a lot of shopping on the internet and your company is the best one I have ever used. Congratulations to all your team and I definitely will be using you again!"
"Thanks very much for keeping me so well informed about my order! It arrived really quickly and I am so pleased with all the items I purchased! "
"Just a quick note to say thank you for the speed and efficiency. If all companies were the same life would be so much easier."
"Would just like to say thank you for such a speedy service. Ordered Sunday teatime and delivery 8.30am Tues morning. Well impressed, would definately recommend. Well done!!"
"Wow!!! What an excellent service, I ordered my goods at 4.30pm yesterday and they were on my doorstep at 7.45am this morning, what can I say? I will be recommending you to everybody I know!"
"I just wanted to say a big thank you, I placed my order yesterday afternoon and it arrived with me at 10am this morning, very impressed especially as I live in the highlands and normally parcels take several days."
"Blimey! Ordered less than 24 hours ago and its here already. Excellent service! Many thanks."
"Thank you all for the VERY FAST delivery of my order. It couldn't have been faster myself if I had gone to a shop and bought the stuff over the counter!!!! I ordered on Friday afternoon and the parcel was here on Saturday morning, in plenty of time for one of the items being given as a gift on Monday morning!!!! I hadn't even had time to go and buy a birthday card or wrapping paper. THANKS FOR A BRILLIANT SERVICE. Its nice to know that it still exists. All the best to everyone involved!"
"May I take this opportunity of saying how impressed I am with your prompt and efficient service. I look forward to dealing with you again. Many thanks."
"Just a quick note to say I am totally impressed with your website and delivery. The order I placed yesterday at 11.11hrs, was delivered first thing this morning. Amazing! Well done and keep up the good work."
"Cheers, parcel turned up today. I only ordered it yesterday afternoon. You lot are awesome. Thanks for the freebies, nice touch. You're the best shop on the Web by miles!!!!"
"Hi I just wanted to congratulate you on the most efficient service I have ever received from an internet based company. Having 2 children I tend to shop online at least once a week, even more so when birthdays and christmas are near. I ordered a 'Candy Grabber' yesterday afternoon, imagine my surprise when the delivery man just knocked at my door at 9.30am. I can't believe that I could order something online at 2.00pm on Wednesday and it is in my possession 9.30am the next morning. I will most certainly order from yourselves again in the near future and will most definately tell all my friends about your fantastic service!"
"I would just like to say thank you for providing such high quality and efficient service! I ordered 3 items yesterday and they arrived to me this morning, well packed and in perfect condition. I am extremely impressed by your wide range of products as well as your exeptional service and shall be recommending you to all my friends. Congratulations on producing a brilliant business from start to finish!"
"I congratulate you on your amazing efficiency. I ordered the Brain Trainer yesterday and it arrived in the post today! This is service beyond the normal expectations, which I will mention to any friends who may be interested in ordering from you."
"Just to advise you that my order from FIREBOX arrived first thing this morning. Talk about a rapid dispatch! It was great to receive the item I ordered as well as two 'bonus' items in-so-much as a pack of 'juicy lips' fun gums and the 'Perplexcity' puzzle cards, no doubt I shall be straining my cerebral cortex over them while I'm supposed to be relaxing on holiday! Very many thanks for your messages, confirmation of details and high level of customer service. I will most definitely be using your company again and have no hesitation in recommending your services to friends in due course. Mind you, on second thoughts, I'll probably hang back from telling all and sundry about your products as I don't wan't everyone knowing where I can source 'unique' gifts in future! Thanks again for the superb service you have provided."
"I ordered 2 of your very nifty PicoZ helicopters. Low and behold my amazement when they arrived (with free Perplex City cards and sweets!) less than 18 hours after order and that was to Northern Ireland!!! Anneka Rice couldn't have got them here any sooner in her own chopper!!! Once again Firebox has beaten their meagre competitors to a pulp and anyone needing lessons on customer service should forget about paying idiot 'life coaches' to tell them where they are going wrong and pay your award winning website a visit! Many thanks from a very happy customer!"
"Thanks for being great. I have ran into a lot of very poor companies recently trying to buy pressies for my husband from those that have no record of my order to just down right rude customer service. However Firebox have been GREAT!!!! you have kept me up to date at every step and delivery was speedy. Thank you thank you thank you. I love shopping and you have restored my faith, I look forward to spending with you again soon!!"
"Awesome! My order arrived less than 24 hours after I placed it. Now we're all in the garden having a shooting match. Never been more impressed by an online shopping experience. Thanks!"
"All I can say is WOW! That is some great service! Even someone phoning me! Amazing!"
"Just thought I'd drop you a quick line to say thank you for brilliant service every time! Your site has something for every occasion and makes buying for the most awkward of people a pleasure. Delivery is never a worry as its so easy to track my orders - not that I need to when I receive handy updates all the way!! Will definitely be recommending you to everyone I know. Keep up the good work! Thanks again!"
"Just scanning your fab website which I buy stuff from time to time ? you come in handy for ?original? wedding presents. The Voodoo Knife Stand is on the cards later this year and The Gazillion Bubble Machine planned for Xmas 2006! But just to say I love the idea to use children?s pics for your company management profile ? brilliant! No other company I have seen does that and it makes shopping with you that more personal and fun! It would be great to see that idea used for other companies in Britain!! I really like the windows media files for viewing products?this really helps in making a decision. Keep up the good site Firebox!"
"I felt compelled to write this email to say how impressed I am with Firebox.com. I placed an order for the Voodoo Knife set yesterday at 2pm. It arrived at 9.15 this morning, and I only paid for standard delivery. Absolutely fantastic and now everyone in the office has seen how outstanding your service can be too. Cheers, well done and keep it up! "
"I received the above order for a Tamagotchi (version 3) yesterday. I just wanted to say thank you for your excellent service! My daughter was so pleased that it arrived so quickly. This is the first time that I have ordered from Firebox, and I will have no hesitation in ordering from you again. Everything from ordering (via phone), packaging and delivery were first class. Thanks again."
"Everything was seamless, easy and no hassle at all. You did what you said you would do and more and I was kept informed at all times. Great service. I'll be back."
"Just a quick note to say I was very impressed with the speediness of your delivery, and very happy with the products. You probably get people moaning at you all day (I am in sales as well!) So just thought I would send you a note of appreciation. I will use Firebox again!"
"I am over the moon. I contacted you yesterday afternoon and have already received my order... Wow, what a great service you give! Your service the last time was great, this time is absolutely brilliant ! Many thanks to all of your staff, you are all a great credit to your "TOP-Company". Thanks for "Fun-Gums". Will definitely order from you again, bye for now."
"Thanks again for dealing with me, the package arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Also, thanks for the sweets. I will certainly plan on using Firebox.com in future!"
"I've bought the odd gift from Firebox. It's always one of my first ports of call when the Xmas panic starts to set in. What I like about Firebox are the range of unusual gifts and excellent service I've always received. I hope you'll share my email with the Firebox team - I know you guys probably don't get as much praise as you deserve from your customers. I really want to thank you for making my life easier because I HATE SHOPPING!!!"
"Abso Fabbo, the Soundbug is just perfect for taking abroad, for using with my MP3. I've been testing it on various object d'audio (made that phrase up). Best performers so far are: 1. melamine picnic plate 2. a huge mirror 3. the lid of the toilet seat (firmly closed). Worst performances were given by sticking it onto: A. Leylandii Bushes B. Jade Goody c. My Rubber Duck. Had loads of fun with it..and also the 6 in 1 Sonic Plug In. Brilliant piece of annoying frustrating amusement.Thanks again!"
"Thanks for speedy delivery of my lovely cushtie cushion..amazing..and free sweets too - always appreciated!"
Jo O'Brien - Mar '06
"Customer service like this is what guarantees return customers -- Firebox has now been added to my list of "trusted" online stores!"
"Just to say a huge thanks for all your help recently. We bought a portable dvd player from you for our daughter for Christmas. Unfortunately it was a bit unreliable so we called you. Your folks on the phone were first class. They were very helpful - and their manner didn't suggest there'd be any problem sorting it all out - and there weren't. They asked us to call back if the problems continued. They did, so we called. They told us to send it right back - and within a few days a new one had arrived. Much to our daughter's delight. You were recommended to us by a friend - and the website is terrific. On top of that, your service was top drawer - from ordering it, to replacing it. I'll certainly recommend you to my pals. Many, many thanks!"
"Just a quick note to say how pleased I was with your service: quick, efficient and hassle free! At least some firms are getting it right ... Thank you."
"Thank you so much - placed my order yesterday afternoon and received it this morning - couldn't believe it!! Brilliant service thank you."
"May I take this opportunity to congratulate your team and your company in general on the excellent service that I received after purchasing a product from Firebox.com. Having placed my order late last Thursday I was not expecting to receive the delivery until the beginning/middle of this week! To my complete shock and delight not to mention surprise the delivery was made on Saturday midday! As I said I really just wanted to thank you and your company for being a credit to internet commerce! The entire service from browsing, payment and delivery could not be described as anything less than first class and entirely user friendly! This was my first purchase from Firebox, and it certainly will not be my last, I look forward to buying from you again in the future."
"I would just like to say thank you for the brilliant service and friendly help. I will certainly have no hesitations in using the company again. Thanks! "
"Just to say congrats to your team. We were given a toy from you for xmas, returned it unopened to swap for something else. Your team contacted us almost immediately and within a week, we have the much wanted mathmos aduki light rather than the not-so-wanted idog. The service we received was second to none, a credit to the company and you will be praised to all our friends. Thanks! "
"You guys are great, I recieved my package this morning and very happy! Thank you."
"Thank you for such great and efficient service! It's a real rarity these days and I feel compelled to compliment you."
"Hi there I didn?t know quite who to email about this but I just wanted to say how impressed I am with your delivery times! I purchased a pack of mini-whinnies yesterday afternoon and have got them already this morning. That is great service and neither words nor expletives will suffice to tell you how impressed I am! My wife is going to love these and the free pack of sweets! Thanks again you?ve made her weekend (and probably mine too!) "
"Good Morning, Just to say thank you for the service (excellent as always) I received recently. You had tried to deliver for the next day, as my order was sent just after the 4.00pm cut-off time. It was only the courier getting the parcel mixed up with their depots that prevented the next day delivery, and someone kindly called me to advise of this. Many thanks!"
"Received today 21st February, excellent service, well done and thanks!"
"Thank you very much for such a fast and superb service. Received my game today and will use you again. Thanks!"
"Order received. Excellent service!!"
"Just to say thank you for dispatching my order so quickly. It arrived this morning and I am very pleased with it. I am sure that I will get be able to get a more comfortable sleep when flying. Many thanks. "
"May I thank you for your efficiency - most impressive. My order has already arrived this morning. "
"The coffee maker arrived on Saturday morning, and it's really great. I can't recommend it highly enough. It makes the smoothest coffee I've ever tasted. Wonderfully quick service from your company. Thank you!"
Jan O'Leary - Feb '06
"Hi, just a quick note to say this is the best company I have ever dealt with over the net. Not only is the site easy to navigate and your payment process quick and simple, I am astounded at the speed you get the goods out of the door. I have ordered twice in the past week and both times received the goods the next day both times - you are a credit to on line shopping and your site is fab - I am telling everyone about it - bravo."
"Just to say thank you for the service (excellent as always) received recently!"
"Wow! A rare quality in today's society, a friendly, helpful and happy sounding customer services representative. I will definitely be using Firebox again. Thanks."
"Hi Firebox, placed my order for a Shinco portable dvd player about 10.00am Wednesday, it arrived 9.00am Thursday. I had three e-mails about it, the deal was great, the kit is superb, all that and a packet of sweets as well. Fantastic customer service! Thank you."
"Just wanted to let you know how impressed I have been with your level of service. I ordered items yesterday afternoon and they were delivered at 8am this morning - well packaged and excellent quality. Thank you!"
"Can I just thank you for such a fantastic SUPER FAST professional service. I only ordered my stick people yesterday at around 11am and they arrived today. That's a ridiculously fast service and you kept me informed all the way. I think all Internet business' or any business should use you as a yard stick of what a business should be run like.. Excellent, well done and thanks!"
"Just wanted to say thanks for the easy, fast service. Recieved the goods this morning with a bag of sweets as a bonus! Thanks very much."
"Hi, recently when I was back at home (on leave from the Army) I was on your site, and found the Wildsling Water Bomb Catapult, I thought this could be a right laugh with the lads back on camp. We live in blocks, that are just across the road from eachother and decided to start a war with Wildslings - Ha Ha. It was all going ok, until disaster struck! I ended up launching a water bomb at full power, and ended up smashing a DOUBLE-GLAZED window !!! Couldn't believe it. Now, I've got to pay for the damage when the bill arrives. Fancy helping towards it - Ha Ha ! Thanks anyway, we had a right laugh. We also went a bit over board, and sat at each end of the corridor with a sling each, and tried to hit and HURT eachother. That was funny too."
"I just want to thank you for extremely good service and prompt delivery! I made an order (my very first with Firebox) for the Sensible Soccer Plug 'N Play games console yesterday at 2.30pm, needless to say it arrived before 9am this morning - now that's what I call service! Many thanks, I will be using Firebox again without a doubt."
"Very fast and efficient. Can't wait to open the box and hope I am as pleased with the contents as I am with customer service!"
"I would like to say that I have found the entire process of dealing with Firebox totally exceptional on all aspects. From navigating your site to finding my product, purchasing it through to receiving delivery. Everything has been second to none. "
"Dear Everyone at Firebox.com! Once again I feel moved to write and congratulate you on your fantastic service, so quick, top class service and as always excellent Christmas presents. Hope you all have a lovely Christmas and very many thanks again!"
"Dearest Firebox Nutters I love you. You are my true Chrimble heroes and Santa definitely should be plopping down all your chimneys as you have all been very good boys and girls this year. Thank you, Merry Christmas and have a Fabulous Firebox 2006!!! "
"I placed an order last week with some stuff that was in stock and some stuff that was pre-ordered. The stuff that was in stock was here days ago and some of the pre-ordered stuff is through too. Just brilliant! What can I say other than that the site is brilliant and the customer service is second to none. The site is full of fantastic, different things which sorted a lot of my Christmas shopping headaches. The customer service is superb as I made a couple of phone calls and your staff are just excellent. So full marks to you all. I shall certainly be using yourselves again. Merry Christmas to you all! "
"Merry Xmas to you all - just wanted to say what a great job your doing! I've ordered a few things and, even when I had to return one and get a replacement the whole thing was handled efficiently. I even like your on hold message, and arrived just in time for me to deliver it to my friends kids. Meltdown was a great success and rapid fire pistols have been in constant use by kids and adults - lots of fun!! Wishing you all the best for 2006 - keep up the good work."
"Just a quick note to praise your company for the best Customer Service I've received all year! I placed an order yesterday afternoon (after the 2pm cut off) for an Atari 13-in-1 Two-Player Paddles. The system generated response told me to expect it Friday (tomorrow) morning between 9-12am as I had opted to pay for the Express delivery and this was the earliest delivery date available. Now this is not an email praising any one individual but your whole team, as I was AMAZED to be woken at 8.00am this morning by the City Link guy with my Atari 13-in-1 Two-Player Paddles! 25 hours early, 2 working days from Christmas! AWESOME! Keep up the good work! (And thanks for the sweeties! Nice touch!)"
"Hi again! Just wanted to say your customer service is amazing! It's a shame you can no longer get that level of customer service in high street stores! Merry Xmas and a happy New Year to you and all of your staff! "
"Thanks for an excellent speedy service. Less than 24 hours from ordering to receiving the goods. I can't wait to use the chocolate fountain on Christmas Day."
"You continue to be simply the best online shopping experience I have ever encountered (and I am not just saying that. Not to mention exemplary customer service standards that other companies can only wish to aspire to.....and sadly fail. Cheers guys and girls!"
"Hi! I would just like to say how thrilled I am with my purchase. I bought the Shinco 7" (bargain) Portable DVD Player and it is fab..but not as amazing as your customer service. I dont tend to go for all out praise but credit where it's due..You guys are the best! Let's hope you go from strength to strength. (Amazing what complementary sweeties do to a girl!)"
"Recieved this morning, well within 24 hours of ordering. Outstanding service!"
"Thank you so much for my two orders. What brilliant customer service! I really appreciate it. Wishing you a wonderful festive season. "
"My order arrived safely today. Thank you for such excellent service. "
"Hello Firebox! Many thanks - how efficient - they arrived on Friday ! Wishing you a happy festive Christmas and New Year."
"Merry Xmas to you all - just wanted to say what a great job you're doing! I've ordered a few things and, even when I had to return one and get a replacement, the whole thing was handled efficiently. I even like your on hold message, and they arrived just in time for me to deliver it to my friend's kids. Meltdown was a great success and the Rapid Fire Foam Disc Shooters have been in constant use by kids and adults - lots of fun!! Wishing you all the best for 2006 - keep up the good work."
"Just thought I'd congratulate you on your service !!! I wish all mail order retailers were as good as you. I'm so impressed, I'm sure my 19 year old will be too this Xmas morning !! What do you buy the kid who has everything? (thanks to dad with big guilt complex and thick wallet- but that's another story !) Your website gave me loads of ideas and I'll be back for more goodies !! Thanks again, I'll be recommending you to everyone."

"Working in customer service myself I know how rarely people actually take the time to say thank you for good service - they're much more inclined to complain! Well, I felt I had to write to say how impressed I've been with Firebox.com recently. I've purchased items from the website twice in the last two weeks and both times been amazed with the speed of delivery. The first time I ordered an item at 3pm on a Friday afternoon and received the item first thing Saturday morning! Then again, I ordered something yesterday lunchtime and I have just received it! Absolutely fantastic! I've told all my friends how good your service is - and you can't get better advertising than word of mouth! Many thanks again, and keep up the good work!"
"Just a note to say this is the first time I?ve used your catalogue. Due to chaotic family life et al I haven?t been to the shops at all this year and did all the Christmas shopping by internet last weekend AND??????.. it?s all arrived in plenty of time! Thank you so much for excellent service and great packing and delivery. Hope you go from strength to strength! Merry Christmas to you all, and thank you again!"
"How on earth did you get my order delivered so quickly? I contacted you last night, and this morning here it is!! The little Christmas tree is gorgeous and I love it. Thank you so much. Kind regards and Merry Christmas to you all. "
"This is the first time I have ordered from your website. You guys are really organised !! It is a pleasure buying from you. "
"Have just received my order which I ordered on-line yesterday. Fantastic service! This is the second order I've had and will certainly use you again, and recommend you to friends."
"'Your shipping and handling is unbelievably fast. My friend received the package 18 hours after I gave the order! And I only paid an extra 2 pounds for express shipping within the UK! I have never seen such speed, neither in the US nor here (Turkey). Thanks for your speed as well!"
"This is my second order from Firebox.com and I?m just writing to say thanks for your amazing service standards and head spinning delivery time. I ordered it yesterday via standard delivery, product came this morning via CityLink, and it's the Christmas season! I am shocked at how quick online shopping can be when it?s done through the right people. You guys are a credit to online shopping! Please show this E-mail to anyone involved with my order, I will be back! "
" Just had to say a big THANK YOU FIREBOX! for the excellent service you provided. Next day delivery during Christmas week thats just silly! Excellent packaging too. I must also mention the Firebox customer service team who were a great help. Hope you have a wonderful Christmas and thank you once again."
"I ordered an ariel puzzle of my in laws area and didnt expect it to arrive until after xmas, but to my pleasent surprise it arrived on the 23rd. It even said on your site that there was no way it could get delivered by Xmas and I was ok with that. It is so nice to find a company, let alone an online company that tries to keep their customers as happy as yours does. Thank you doesn't get said enough these days though everyone is quick enough to complain when something goes wrong. So to this end I would greatly appreciate it if you could pass on my heartfelt thanks to all your team and although you wont get this till after Xmas have a wonderful time and THANK YOU."
"I've been meaning to write this for a while... I am a regular and long term customer of Firebox. I keep coming back because your products are inspiring and your delivery is amazing! I placed an order yesterday at 09:50 using your standard delivery and it arrived with me this morning at 09:10 - incredible! I've told friends about you and I know that they now order regularly (including stuff for my birthday!) and feel the same. Thanks very much indeed! "
"Many thanks! A quick and painless procedure, you put other internet companies to shame!"
"I'm sure people are quick enough to complain so I thought I'd drop a line to thank you for the amazing quick response and delivery. Brilliant stuff and will definitely use you again. "
"Dear guys & gals at Firebox, Just wanted to say thank you very much for the super-speedy delivery of my i-Dog!! I've shopped with you a few times & have consistently been impressed with the standard & speed of the service. Your company is truely a one off - long may it continue!"
"This is just to say thanks for your excellent service. I placed an order at about 13:25 on Thursday. This was acknowledged at 13:31. At 13:41 I received an email saying my order was awaiting packing and dispatch. By 15:00 you emailed me to say that my order had been dispatched using Royal Mail.

"Sorry to be so geeky about this, I've never written in to praise any service before, and 'sucking up' is against my very nature but - you excelled yourselves yesterday. I ordered a present for my 10 year old son's birthday at around 4pm on Thursday, and it arrived by ordinary post before 8 the next morning, beautifully packaged and I got to eat the complimentary sweeties! (He'll never know!) If you go in for this sort of thing, please feel free to publish this wherever, you earned it big time! Thanks alot "

"I just wanted to thank you very much for the excellent service I have received from Firebox.com. This is the first time I have used your company and I must say I am very impressed. The website was easy to use, the updates on the order progress were really handy and it was excellent to have a telephone number to ring if I had problems. Obviously, I didn't need to use this but it was a real plus to know that I could talk to someone if I needed to. So many times I've used sites which only respond to you by email, and sometimes you just can't resolve issues without talking direct to a human being. Thanks again for excellent service. I will certainly be using you again and will recommend you to others as well"
"Thanks very much - quality customer service "

"Do you have an actual 'pun department' headed by a Creative Pun Director with a team of wordsmiths who pun-box their brains out in between triple espressos, or is it all collaboratively inspired by an over- stimulative environment and a lack of sleep? Whatever the answer, some are truly inspired; please pass on my thanks for making me giggle before typing my credit card number in."

Many thanks."

As soon as I can get them off of my teeth I'll be fine!! I will certainly use your company again as I enjoy the light-hearted way that you write your sales literature. I was, in fact, going to order the Darth Vader Light Sabre but, at 65 years of age, my wife has told me to stick to my Batman outfit!! Best wishes for your continued success."

I wrote him a note to apologise that his present would be late, as I thought that there was no way that it would arrive in time for the big day. I couldn't have been more delighted when it arrived this morning, on time for his birthday. Thank you very much for such prompt service. It couldn't have been better."
"Top notch service - from the sweets in the packaging - to the guy on the phone who said not to worry if the 'tamagotchi' I had pre-ordered turned out to be pink, as it is a "manly pink" - quality. Was desperately trying to get a tamagotchi before Father Christmas came - you said they would eventually be in stock but could not guarantee delivery before Christmas - fair enough - you shipped it out at 3.40pm December 23rd - it was in my grubby mitts at 9.30am the next day - fantastic. Result: two relieved parents, one ("yes, yes, yes I've got one") over the moon seven-year old and one more happy Firebox customer. I have since seen a pink tamagotchi and it is quite manly"
"Ordered from you Mon afternoon parcel arrived Tues morning. Fantastic service, thank you"
"Thanks very much, great service as always, you guys are the best internet site I've ever bought from!"
"I ordered a Skype Cyberphone on thursday afternoon and i'm very pleased to say that it arrived first thing the next morning. I loved the cola bottles you put in the box. Brilliant touch. But I just wanted to let you know that I was delighted with the phone and I also priced around. What i was very surprised at, is that although I love my toys, i usually find that gadget shops are too expensive to buy from, but you were the cheapest (I checked all the shops listed in voipvoice.com). Anyways Thanks again and Ill be buying a lot more of these for my friends and family. You will also be my first place to look for my gadgets."

I received said Lightsaber (with the free Kerplunk you so kindly provided) at 13:00 today. How you've managed to get my order to me so bleeding fast, is beyond my comprehension. And for it to be cheaper than your rival's sites at the same time...is mindboggling. The force is indeed strong with your staff. Great, you are. Cheers very, very much."

"I just thought I should say...I have never been more impressed with the quality of your service from any company, in the world, ever.

I recieved it early the next day. Simply superb. Nothing else to it. The BEST customer service EVER. Thankyou firebox!!"

He said he was really impressed by how quick the gifts arrived and that although the Love Tokens had sold out it was only 2 days later that they arrived...I dont think my husband and I have ever ordered anything via email and had it arrive so quickly. We are both impressed. I would also like to say that all the gifts you have for Valentines are absolutely lovely and although I shouldnt have opened my gifts so early I have told loads of people at work about the site....so fingers crossed they are all logging on and ordering lots!!!"

I've never had a problem before, but I think it tells a customer a lot about a company how they handle things when they don't go smoothly - and you've been great. You've sorted out the problem really quickly and kept in touch and I'll look forward to placing an order with you again. I'd be grateful if you'd pass my thanks on to everyone concerned - it's a wonderful example of good customer service. "

This is the second time I've ordered gifts through the website and this is the second time they have turned up less than 12 hours later, absolutely fantastic - especially for a girl who is as impatient as me! Your company has made shopping for gifts for boytfriends a doddle. Ta very muchly"

"Dear Firebox, I found the perfect birthday gift for my Brother on your website "The Pull It Corkscrew" (we also have one and they are great). As we live in Australia it is much easier to order online and deliver directly to his address in the UK. I placed my order on line on Friday and Saturday morning I rang my Sister-in-Law to let her know that his birthday present would be arriving later on that week. To my surprise she said it had already arrived at 8:00 am Saturday morning !! Just wanted to say what great and speedy service. (she also thought the sweets were a nice touch too) I would certainly recommend your website to others. Thanks again."

"Just wanted to say a BIG thankyou for your great service regarding my order. Sat in the office bored on friday trawling the web, found your website and HAD to have the SEGA 6 in 1 game pad.

Thank you for providing the service you promise (sadly not a common occurence these days)."
"I would Just like to say that Kristian Bromley is doing a fine job! Thank You So Much, "
"Had to send you a comment on the Shinco 7" DVD player. I bought one recently and it really is a little pearl. We used it on holiday to keep the little one entertained on flights and plugged into the hotel TV. It plays absolutely anything - any region, almost any format and in almost any condition. So far it has withstood the probing fingers of the little person and the nice aluminium case should mean it remains reasonably damage free for some time. An excellent purchase"

"I?ve seen the superlatives and general compliments on firebox?s site, but I can add my own now. When the delivery time for iPod minis went back from April to July 2004, firebox sent me an email to say that it would try to source some direct from the US and fulfill orders that way; I was heartened, but a bit sceptical, but now you?ve done it, and I have my iPod mini. I can?t offer enough praise. Firebox did what other sites can?t do, and you didn?t charge my credit card until the goods were with me. And the delivery charge was risible too. And I have an iPod in advance of UK availability?Life doesn?t get better than this. I?m a big fan ? I?ll be back for more. "
"Well congratulations, this is the first time I have used your website and the goods arrived today! Marvellous service since I ordered yesterday, I buy from lots of web sites and generally find that the service is mediocre and that their stock level counters are really poor but not in your case. Keep up the good work."
"Thanks so much! I order was delivered today and I'm thrilled. They are gifts for my husband, who's birthday is in a few months time. I hope all is in order as he's going to be delighted with his presents. I am going to get a good giggle watching him play with his lightsaber! "

"Hello, Just a quick one to say thanks very much and what great service. I ordered some presents yesterday morning and they arrived at work this morning before I did! I've passed on your website to the 120 odd people I work with on our social intranet, and told them how great you guys are! I won't be looking anywhere else for presents from now on. Thanks again."
"Hi Firebox I don't normally do this but I had to write and say how impressed I am with your speedy and efficient service. I've used you before and I will definitely do so again - and I will be recommending your site to anyone who'll listen! Many thanks. Lindsey"

"I just had to let you know about the FANTASTIC customer service I received from your company recently. I ordered your product "My Last Rolo" from yourselves and received it in a matter of days, I presented it to my husband, who was really pleased with his anniversary gift, then my mothers dog also took a liking to it, and unbeknown to anyone, "ate" the box. I e'mailed Firebox at 7:05 the next morning before I went to work, when I came home and checked my e'mail I had received a reply at 10:00 am from Kristian Bromley explaining they had contacted the supplier and a new box would be despatched shortly - and to my disbelief when I arrived at work at 09:15 the following morning, there was a new box. So, I would just like to say thank-you again for such excellent service, I wouldn't hesitate in recommending FIREBOX.com to anyone. Many thanks, again. "
"It has been a long time ago since I have experienced that kind of good customer service! Answers are rapid and clear. Due to this fact, we are going to bye more products at your store later! Thanks again."

Despite the faulty kit, service like this adds confidence to the purchaser, knowing that when things do go wrong you sort it quickly and without quibble Thanks very much Sarah."
"Just wanted to say thank you for my delivery. This is the third time I have ordered anything from you and regardless of whether the order was for less than ?30 or more than ?100, you've delivered the same quality of service. Well done, my third time will certainly not be the last."
"The service is great, the product (Pocket DV4 Camcorder) is excellent. If only all web companies are like this one. Thumbs up."
"Just a short note to say thank you for assistance in this matter. Customer service of this level is rare these days (Unfortunately) and refreshing. While I was disappointed when the camera stopped working, I will still shop with you in the future as I have the confidence that any problems will be resolved quickly and efficiently. I do not normally have the time to send notes like this, but I felt I should in this instance. Please feel free to publish these comments if you wish."

Your exemplary standards have re-affirmed my previously flagging confidence in this country's customer service industry. Even your hold music was ingenious - I was gutted when I got through as I had been enjoying "jumping up and down like an angry monkey"! Why has no-one thought of this before? I had the site recommended to me (regular weasal coffee purchaser) and will recommend to all. 10/10 to everyone there. If you knew me you'd realise that compliments are very few and far between and I am not one to being so gushing but credit where credit is due. I can't wait to do my Christmas shopping!"
