"I've been on Simvastatin 10mg for the last 6 months. I've noticed the last 4 months or so severe pain in my legs & hips. I can barely move sometimes. Sleeping is very painful at night. There is a stiffness and I can barely move without pain. I'm going off this Cholesterol medication. Calling my Dr soon! I have not had my blood work rechecked yet so I don't know what my numbers are."
"Taking drug for over 24 years...Past three years complained to doctors of breathing problems...recently told of kidney function defect...No mention of simvastatin concerns. I checked internet and am convinced side effects mentioned are taking place. I am going to different doctor to check out concerns"
"I took this drug for 3 months. I just stopped it now with doctor's approval. I stopped because I was getting tightness in my chest, burning sensations on my skin, sore breasts, and was getting depressed. Yes it did lower my cholesterol, but it's not worth it to me if it causes depression. Apparently, this drug can inhibit serotonin production. If you have any history of depressive disorder, I would NOT take this drug. My father took the pill as well, but just stopped because he has had trouble with walking this year. He had burning sensations down his legs this year. We think his walking troubles *may* have something to do with Simvastatin. Perhaps Simvastatin doesn't hurt everyone, but my opinion of it is poor. Trust your gut."
Zocor (simvastatin): "I am currently on 20mg Zocor and started taking it six months ago. After I got my cholesterol checked again, the LDL went down 90 points! No side effects."
Zocor (simvastatin): "Started this med about 11 years ago. It dropped my level to below avg. I always associated my aches and pains to my age and activity level, but I've discontinued its use for about 3 weeks because my finger joints felt swollen and arthritic. I'm starting to feel a slow improvement. My additional symptoms are sore hips and other joints. To be fair, I won't be able to discern whether this is the drug or some other factor until staying off it longer."
"I am 59 , very active, on thyroid and blood pressure medication for at least a year. All was good. Started taking simvastatin due cholesterol results. Took one at night after dinner 20 mg for two days. On the second day, while driving , I was getting extremely sleepy. Kept waking myself up by slapping my face. I had a blank moment while driving...woke up when the car hit a kerb with a thud!. Obviously now I don't think I will take this simvastatin. I will have to tell my doctor that she almost lost her patient and took a few other people off ."
"have taken Simvastin 80mg for eight years. Cholestrol level is down and stable. I wake up some nights around 3pm.wide awake.I get irritable and angry at times..high tummy pains.some days the need to urinate quite often.I didnt realise until reading information here that it may be the statins causing these side effects. All in all im happy with the results."
"Simvastatin was A total nightmare for me. Lower half of back,hips,and legs were so painful,I could barely walk. For me It was like A Intense burning sensation.And this was after my first dose,and this was my last."
"I have been taking simvastatin for 10 years to treat high cholesterol with good success. I have not experienced any adverse side effects."
Zocor (simvastatin): "Been taking Zocor for a while now. Between 1-2 years. Seemed to feel OK, but heart always felt like it was skipping beats. Then about 3 weeks ago it happened every afternoon about 4PM daily scaring me because they were lasting for a long time. I don't know anything but this medicine so I figured this must be my problem. So I just stopped the Zocor {simvastatin} and to amazement no more heart palapations."
"Started suffering acid reflux after a year on Simvastatin. Struggled to swallow it, felt as if it was lodged in my throat. Stopped taking it a month ago, having blood test this week to check cholesterol level."
Zocor (simvastatin): "The side effects of this medication are terrible. The dizziness, headache, and not being able to understand what was going on, felt like I was in a cloud. "
"About one week after I started taking it, I started with mild leg cramps. After 3 weeks, I couldn't stand it anymore. They would wake me up at night and throb, so I stopped taking it. I can't really rate effectiveness as I wasn't on it long enough."
"Tried 4 other statins. Simvastatin has no morning foot pain. Additional benefit is no more erectile dysfunction."
"I have been taking this pill for almost a year. Recently I noticed my hair feels so fine, so tonight I have stopped it. I will call my Doc in the morning. I also have felt dizzy have vision problems. This has just started in the past week. Dizzy I can handle, losing hair, not so much!"
"Taking this medication and having leg cramps that became severe. Did not know the source of the cramps at night. Stopped for a month and leg cramps disappeared. Started again and immediately had night leg cramps, severe enough to get me out of bed over and over again."
Zocor (simvastatin): "It worked and no side effects that I noticed."
Zocor (simvastatin): "Only been taking for about two weeks. Feel lethargic, achy, headache, hot flashes are worse. Depression, occasional stomach pain. Muscle pain."
"Since I started taking simvastatin 20mg at bedtime, I am not sleeping well, joint pain, tiredness and my acid reflux is so bad I cant stand it anymore. Not sure if the simvastatin is the problem, but was not having the issues with my acid reflux while taking my nexium until I started taking simvastatin. Talked with my pharmacy and they told me that the simvastatin does not worsen acid reflux, it does seems funny, I was not having a problem with it until I started taking the simvastatin."
Zocor (simvastatin): "This statin cause extreme pain in my knee and hip."
Zocor (simvastatin): "This about the 4th time they have tried me on Statins... after a week on Zocor, have severe backaches, muscles aches, and pains in my wrists where I previously had carpel tunnel surgery. I have been on it about a week. I will stop it, since I trust my bodies response to these medicines. If you experience problems with any medicine don't keep taking it without telling your doctor."
"Was prescribed simvastation for elevated cholesterol and family history of atherosclerosis. It was very effective in lowering my cholesterol and my side effects were minimal. I did experience insomnia after several weeks which became increasingly worse over the two years I have been taking it. I was doing good to get five hours of sleep each night, sometimes only three, however never felt tired. I have decided to stop taking it for awhile and am now sleeping a full eight hours and feeling less "edgy". Hope to lower cholesterol with exercise and diet."
"I have been on Simvastatin (5mg/day) for a month. It has worked wonders. My High Cholesterol is family related, and without much change to my diet (besides raisin brand for cereal, and more tea), it has lowered significantly within a month. My HDL was 37, it is now 45. My LDL was 173, and is now 91. My Total Cholesterol had been 234, and it is now 154. This is great news for me, and I have not had any side effects that I have been able to feel as of yet (possibly because I'm on such a low dose). I only have rave reviews for Simvastatin."
"I am on 20mg. I take it right before I go to bed. After 15 minutes my heart starts racing. However, I have no problems falling asleep. If I had to take this in the morning I wouldn't be able to stand the racing heart. Other than that, I feel good so far. My cholesterol was 204 & triglycerides are at 130. I am 43 and have started walking 3 miles at a good pace 5-6 days a week. Drinking lots of water and no caffeine. I have just had my next blood work since being on this medicine, so we'll see if it's doing it's job."
"It lowered my cholesterol from 258 to 221 after one month but I have numbness in my extremities and pain in my ankles. I wake up with numb limbs and sore ankles. Everyday since I started taking this."
"I am taking simvastatin after dinner meal 40mg as per my doctor's prescription. I feel fine."
"I am so happy I looked up Simvastatin here today. It was incredibly helpful. I had been having left knee pains originally and then calf and behing the thigh pains plus backaches sometimes from neck down. I now know from all the reports from users here that is was caused by this medicine. "
"Was on Simvastatin for approximately 8 weeks for high cholesterol. Experienced extreme muscle weakness in arms and legs, along with severe muscle spasms at night. Also began to have increased depression (have been on Paxil for 10 years), confusion, memory problems, and unexplainable irritability, anger, and paranoia. After 7 days without the Simvastatin, most of these complaints have subsided, although still having muscle pain and slight spasms at night."
Zocor (simvastatin): "After taking Zocor for several months I experienced sleeplessness, indigestion and anxiety. Depression soon set in. Anti-depressants cannot be taken with Zocor so I stopped it. Antidepressants all came with side effects. So I stopped them too. After several weeks of counseling and breathing techniques I was back to my old self. Doctor put me back on Zocor and 2 weeks later sleeplessness, depression, indigestion are back. I am stopping this medicine."
"Had taken medication for 8 months noticed that my muscle control was weakening and had acid reflux , which I had to take medication for. After going off this medication my muscle control strengthened and acid reflux was gone. "
"Started with a cholesterol of 235 and 3 months later my cholesterol went down to 140. No side effects!"
"I take simvastatin. My level was 238 and dropped to 200 on 1 x 10 mg per day but before the 238 I was 250. I am now on 20mg and soon to take blood work and no problem at all. I take at night. I am sure it will be lower. Also My husband had 243 and he is down to 138 on one 10 mg per day but he moves a lot and I'm not as much. I had NO SIDE EFFECTS and I am medicine sensative and was scared to take it but I am so glad I did so try a low dose then up it if you don't have any side effects. "
"I've been on Lipitor and now simvastatin 80mg for the past 13 to 15 years. For most of these years I have had no side effects and my cholesterol went down from 238 to 104.2. I was exercising pretty regularly. However, during this past year I have started to feel a lot of joint pain in my shoulders and now in my hips. I used to walk and run on my treadmill and take walks with my wife but because of the hip pain I'm experiencing I no longer can walk farther than around the block. I also get very tired after about 3 to 4 hrs from getting up in the morning and need a nap. I am 60 years old."
"Just started taking it so no results yet, but I did have a headache the first 4 days I took it."
"For me, only simvastatin by Cobalt Labs did not cause severe muscle and joint pain. The others contain a filler that causes the pain."
Zocor (simvastatin): "I was prescribed Zocor back in January 2011 and after about two weeks of taking the medication I experienced changes that was unusual. My heart was racing so I stopped. After visiting my doctor to have my blood pressure checked, I informed her that I haven't been taking the medication. She was not happy and requested I schedule another blood test to check my cholesterol which I did. A few days after the test she put me back on Zocor which I have been taking March 10th. Since starting back on Zocor, I have experienced not sleeping through the night and continuous burping. I am not very good about exercise and have a problem with my diet so I do need some type of medication. "
"Was prescribed simvastatin, but after taking it for 6 weeks I became very ill (freezing cold and shivering) and not really knowing what was happening to me. After visit to doctors was admitted to hospital as emergency with liver problems. After blood tests the nurse confirmed it was the simvastatin that caused the problems. It made me diabetic, in fact caused everything in my body to malfunction. So pleased I stopped taking it immediately. It caused bile and biliribin levels to go through the roof. Happily after six months and operation for blocked bile ducts, everything has slowly got back to normal (not diabetic now either)."
"Took simvastatin only once and had a bad case of vertigo within 30 minutes of going to sleep. The next day I felt OK for the most part, but that night I was playing drums in my band and had to stop after 40 minutes (we normally practice an hour and a half or more) because I was so exhausted. The rest of the night I felt like my whole body was being squeezed, and my muscles were really weak. I woke up 3 times during the night with my heart racing and feeling like I was going to pass out. I drank 1 liter of water in 2 hours, and finally fell asleep at 4AM. If I hadn't improved after 4AM I would have gone to the hospital. The next day I felt almost 100%, but my left arm ached all day. And this was just taking it once. It's not for me."
"I've used this medication for many years. I'm currently at 60 MG per day (single dose). It has done a good job, although my good/bad ratio could be a bit better still. HOWEVER, I do notice muscle aches when I use it. If I stop it, they stop. They are generally not severe, and not bad enough for me to stop using it. I've been told (by my doctor and others) that an over the counter supplement called CoQ10 can help this-I've not tried this as of yet. For people with muscle issues(check with the doctor if severe, of course), it may be worth a try (the CoQ10, I mean)."
"Took generic simvastatin for 10 days. Lowered my cholesterol by 60 points from 200 to 140. Had to stop taking it though because of muscle pain side effects. Taking Crestor now for 5 days. No side effects so far. Wish there was a generic."
"This medicine has been very helpful in controlling my high cholesterol at an affordable price."
Zocor (simvastatin): "This medication landed me in the ER after a week. I was having so much back pain that I could not stand or walk. I was wheeled in. The pain was so severe they had to use Dilaudid to bring it down and send me home on it for several days. I have always had back pain so I was not sure at first that this was the cause. I am now. I figure I can not take "Statins" and currently take nothing. I can take Zetia if I have to. It felt like my back was bone on bone. All my disc felt out in my lower back and crushed. The most pain I had been in ever. Probably a good drug for some but not for me."
"It lowered my Cholesterol numbers and put my LDL and HDL numbers in normal range. It did work for me but I had some muscle pain in my legs which would come and go."
Zocor (simvastatin): "Today is my second day of taking 20 mg ZOCOR. I have totally lost my sleep. The brain is very active and despite efforts to calm myself can not sleep. "
"Emergency angioplasty on June 19th - 56 year young woman, LDL was 150. 6 weeks on Simvastatin 40mg before bed, stopped all butter changed to Smart Balance, 80-100 oz water daily, lost 15 lbs, LDL is 54. WOW. On other medicines, so really can't tell if any side effects as associated with Simvastatin, but great results."
"Lowered bad cholesterol from 130 to under 70."
Zocor (simvastatin): "Zocor worked to lower my cholesterol from 288 to 150 with exercise, but the side effects became progressively worse and worse until I had to choose not to take it. I wondered if I had developed lupus because my entire body ached. My hips, my ankles, my wrists, my entire shoulder joints. I felt exhausted and had no energy. I stopped and could tell a 90% change in 48 hours. My joints and muscles are back to normal and my energy level has increassed."
"229 down to 139 in a few months on 40 mg simvastatin. I had been over 220 for many years. Shocked me."
"Started taking Simvastatin 5 days ago. I warned my doctor that statin's caused cramping every time I took them. She assured me that would not be the case, she was wrong. Only 5 days and I've lost a nights sleep and am in pain most of the time."
Zocor (simvastatin): "I took Zocor for 3 months then started to have pain, swelling and loss of strength in hands & fingers. Doctor said that was not one of the side effects of Zocor but reduce to every other day. Didn't help so I quit taking it and within 3 weeks hands felt better. He changed me to Lipitor in December.... we'll see if any side effects develop. Did not have cholesterol checked in the 3 months on Zocor - don't know the effectiveness."
"I began to have bruising around insulin injection sites; it looked like I was on anti-coagulants. I am having pain in my joints, and numbness and tingling throughout my body, including my face and tongue. I have a decrease in my ability to taste food. Also, I am bruising from mild injuries with dark purple areas at the site of the bruise."
"I took every medicine known to man for my cholesterol and had very bad side effects including not being able to walk at all. I started taking simvastatin about a year ago as a last resort and I love it. I have had no side effects and I can actually walk with no problems."
"Been taking this for 4 months. Having joint pain and abdominal issues. Going to take a break to see how if it gets better. Used to take Lipitor without issues."
Zocor (simvastatin): "Doctor prescribed Zocor to lower Cholesterol (269 total and triglyceride 377, way too high). I took it after evening meal with full glass of water as directed. Within the hour I had a raging headache; my heart was pounding. I could hear the blood pulse through my head (I have 2 maybe 3 headaches per year so this was not normal). I spent a very long and painful, sleepless night, waiting and suffering. I tell you this much, 9:00am couldn't arrive fast enough. Doctor told me "headache" was not a side effect of Zocor and to keep taking it. I stopped against doctors advice and now feel great again. Cholesterol is still very high but no more headaches."
"Works fine. I missed about 5 days and it showed on my lab work."
Zocor (simvastatin): "It did the job."
"Original total cholesterol value was 237. Prescribed 10mm of Crestor and had stomach cramps. Two weeks later prescribed 10mg of Simvastatin. After 3 months, recent blood test revealed a total cholesterol value of 139. No side effects and all other blood test results were in normal levels. Works for me."
Zocor (simvastatin): "I started taking Zocor about a week ago. I have had no problems. There is a numbness in my upper left leg on the outside of the thigh. Anyway, have had no other problems so I am rating it a 10."
"lowered my cholestrol 70 points in 3 months - normal for the first time in my life! 56 yr old female"
"I am a 42 year old male. Have been taking simvastatin 20mg for about 2 and a half months now. No side effects and I'm amazed at how my numbers have dropped. My wife is thrilled as well."
"I had to stop taking it because of all the side effects. I had severe stomach pain. "
"I am unfortunately one of those who had a bad experience with Simvastatin. It may have been the combination with 10mg Lisinopril, 25mg Spironolactone and 20 mg of Furosemide; but I got progressively worse over a five month period. I went cold turkey one day when my hands were hit with a tremor and I couldn't type. Within 24 hours of quitting I could feel the changes and in one week I felt better."
"appears to work satisfactorily. Dr. instructions to take each night but appears to work just as well taken with the multitude of other tablets prescribed by him and the hospital each morning"
Zocor (simvastatin): "Lowered my cholesterol to 121 without any side effects."
Zocor (simvastatin): "Zocor 20mg/daay for two months. My sister's lipid level is normal already and no any side effect."
Zocor (simvastatin): "I was prescribed zocor for high cholesterol and after several weeks I began to experience heart palpitations and irregular heartbeats. When I stopped this medication all symptoms stopped. I have had the same experience with crestor. I cannot take either drug to lower cholesterol."
